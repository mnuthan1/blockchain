*Block Chain Basics
A Block chain is chain of blocks, each block will have its own signature/hash and a reference to previous block signature/hash with some data (for eg: ledger)

Each block will not only have reference to previous block signature/hash, but its own signature is calculated using previous block signature/hash

Chanding data in a block will change its hash and there by affecting hashes of all blocks there after.
